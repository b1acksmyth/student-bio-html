                <p>Hello! My name is Spencer Smith and I am a student at UCI learning how to become a web developer. I will also be a lifeguard again for the City of Newport Beach. I have been working there for 13 summers now. I got married to my lovely wife on May 4, 2019 and have been loving every minute of it so far. Some of my favortie things to do are read a good book, play online games with friends that have moved far away, and build keyboards and computers from just the basic parts.</p>
                <p>I am very excited to see what I can do throughout this class and learn how to make even better websites in the future. With that being said, how cool is it thath I can make something like this from nothing??? I mean, come on! so cool...</p>
